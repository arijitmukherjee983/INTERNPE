# INTERNPE
## Task - 1
### Technology:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Platform: Google Colab



### Solution Approach:
1. Data Collection:
Gather patient data with features like age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin, etc., from public datasets (e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset).

2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize or standardize features for better model performance.
Feature selection/reduction.

3. Model Selection:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

4. Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
Train the model using the training data.

5. Model Evaluation:
Test accuracy score and make predictions from training dataset.
