# INTERNPE
## Task - 1 (Diabetes Prediction)
### Technology:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Platform: Google Colab



### Solution Approach:
1. Data Collection:
Gather patient data with features like age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin, etc., from public datasets (e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset).

2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize or standardize features for better model performance.
Feature selection/reduction.

3. Model Selection:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

4. Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
Train the model using the training data.

5. Model Evaluation:
Test accuracy score and make predictions from training dataset.

## Task - 2 (Car Price Prediction)

### Technology:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Platform: Google Colab

### Solution Approach:
1. Data Collection:
Loaded quikr_car.csv with 892 entries and 6 columns: name, company, year, Price, kms_driven, fuel_type.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Removed non-numeric values, filtered out invalid prices, handled missing values, and standardized the name column.

3. Analysis: Explored relationships between car prices and features using visualizations.

4. Model Training:
Split data into features and target; trained a linear regression model with high RÂ² score (~0.90).

5. Output: Saved the model as LinearRegressionModel.pkl for future use.
