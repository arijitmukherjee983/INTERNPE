# INTERNPE
## Task - 1
### Technology:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks:
- Scikit-learn (for ML algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees)
- Pandas, NumPy (for data processing and manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Google Colab (for experimentation and development)


### Solution Approach:
#### 1. Data Collection:
Gather patient data with features like age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin, etc., from public datasets (e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset).

#### 2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize or standardize features for better model performance.
Feature selection/reduction.

#### 3. Model Selection:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

#### 4. Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
Train the model using the training data.

#### 5. Model Evaluation:
Test accuracy score and make predictions from training dataset.
